## Big O

- Big O is the upper bound on time. _printing an array is O(n) and O(n^2), ..., O(2^n)_
- Big Omega (Ω) is the lower bound on time. _printing an array is Ω(n) and Ω(log n) and Ω(1)_ 
- Big Theta (Θ) is the average complexity. _printing elements in an array. the average complexity would be Θ(n)_
- In industry, we speak of big O complexity by computing average complexity Θ Big Theta.
